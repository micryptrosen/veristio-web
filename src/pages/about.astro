      <h1>About Veristio</h1>

      <p>
        Veristio is a software company focused on building verification-first platforms
        for enterprise and technical environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our tools are designed to help organizations prove outcomes and generate
        defensible evidence-without assuming operational control or continuous access.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe that clarity, restraint, and trust are essential when software is
        used in audit, compliance, and high-stakes operational contexts.
