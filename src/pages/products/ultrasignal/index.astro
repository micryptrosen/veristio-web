  <h1>UltraSignal</h1>

  <p>
    UltraSignal is a security information and event management platform built
    to prioritize signal quality, operator trust, and defensible evidence
    over alert volume and opaque automation.
  </p>

  <h2>What UltraSignal Does</h2>

  <p>
    UltraSignal collects, correlates, and presents security-relevant events
    in a way that supports investigation, review, and accountability.
    It is designed for environments where clarity and auditability matter
    more than raw ingestion scale.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Event collection and normalization across diverse sources</li>
    <li>Correlation focused on meaningful security signals</li>
    <li>Evidence retention suitable for audit and review</li>
    <li>Operator-driven investigation workflows</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

  <p>
    UltraSignal favors transparency over automation opacity. It avoids
    excessive alerting, unexplained scoring, and black-box decision paths.
    Analysts retain visibility into why events matter and how conclusions
    are reached.
  </p>

  <h2>Where It Fits</h2>

  <p>
    UltraSignal serves as the event and evidence layer within the Veristio
    suite, integrating naturally with diagnostic and validation workflows.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Consumes health and diagnostic context from
      <a href="/products/ultranox">UltraNOx</a> to enrich investigations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Provides defensible evidence and timelines for
      <a href="/products/ultrapro">UltraPro</a> analysis and reporting.
    </li>
    <li>
      Supports controlled and regulated environments alongside
      <a href="/products/ultracontrol">UltraControl</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Roadmap Direction</h2>

  <p>
    Ongoing development is focused on improving correlation fidelity,
    evidence handling, and integration depth, while maintaining analyst
    clarity and operational trust.
